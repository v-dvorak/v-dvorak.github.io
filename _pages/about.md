Welcome, I’m Vojtěch Dvořák (*vojcɛx dvor̝aːk*), an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Charles University in Prague, with a focus on machine learning.

I am passionate about outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, through which I explore nature. I’ve spent many months hitchhiking and traveling by various means to discover new places and meet new people. I enjoy playing computer games (The Witcher, Metro series, Factorio, Mashinky, RimWorld) as well as board and card games (Catan, Carcassonne, Mariasch). 

Additionally, music plays a significant role in my life; I appreciate various genres and enjoy playing musical instruments. My interests also include reading books, photography, and memes.
