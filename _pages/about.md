Welcome, I am Vojtech Dvorak, an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Charles University in Prague, with a focus on machine learning.

My interests are music, maths and other arts. I used to read a lot, if you se me reading nowadays I'm most likely trying to navigate through the universe of the Dune series.
