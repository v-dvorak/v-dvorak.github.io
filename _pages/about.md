Welcome, I’m Vojtěch Dvořák (*vojcɛx dvor̝aːk*), an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Charles University in Prague, with a focus on machine learning and optical object detection.

I’m all about outdoor adventures like hiking and cycling. I’ve hitchhiked and traveled a ton, always chasing new experiences. When I’m not outdoors, I’m into gaming - both computer games like The Witcher, RimWorld, the Metro series and Factorio, and board or card games like Catan, Carcassonne, Mariasch.

Music is a big part of my life too - I love all kinds of it and enjoy playing instruments. I’m also into books, photography, and of course, memes!
